I’m a Senior Software Engineer and Team Lead with 20+ years of experience building and shipping software across a wide range of stacks. I’m strongest in Ruby, but I’m comfortable moving between Node.js, Go and modern JavaScript frameworks like Vue/Nuxt. I care about clean architecture, developer experience, and building systems that are reliable and easy to reason about.

Lately I’ve been focused on backend architecture, CI/CD, containerization, and deploying applications to Kubernetes on AWS. I enjoy leading teams through complex projects, simplifying messy systems, and staying current with new tools, languages, and ideas.

Specialties: Ruby, Node.js/Javascript, Vue.js, Go, CSS, HTML, SQL, Postgres, Redis
